    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis considers data about math and reading scores from the 15 schools present in the district.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across both types of schools, charter schools performed better than district schools when observing math, reading, and overall pass rates. This is because charter schools displayed common trends with the ones correlating with achieving higher pass rates. The trends are:\n",
    "- School sizes below 2000 students experience a better math and reading academic performance.\n",
    "- Spending budgets less $585 per student results in a better math and reading academic performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, across all schools in the district, the overall percentage of students passing both math and reading was weighed down by the percentage of students passing math. This passing rate was significantly lower than the percentage of students passing reading so more focus is required on math. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion one:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Schools which had less than 2000 students experienced a significantly higher percentage of students passing both reading and math (approximately 31-32% higher than schools with 2000-5000 students). \n",
    "\n",
    "It was also found that spending more than $585 per student would not equate to a higher passing rate in either subject, in fact the higher the budget per student, the more progressively worse passing rates became; the bottom performing schools (based on the overall passing rate of both math and reading) all spent over \\\\$630 per student. \n",
    "\n",
    "⅞ of the charter schools analysed had less than 2000 students and spent less than \\\\$630 per student. Whereas 6/7 of the district schools did have over 2000 students and spent more than \\\\$630 per student. Therefore, it is recommended not to budget above \\\\$630 per student if you wish to achieve a higher passing rate in both math and reading within that school.\n",
    "\n",
    "To depict how much of a difference this decision could make, Charter schools had a overall passing % (for both math and reading) of 90.43% whereas District schools had a overall passing % (for both math and reading) of only 53.67%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion two:**\n",
    "\n",
    "More focus is needed on increasing the passing rate of math per school.  The percentage of students passing reading across all schools in the district was 10.82% higher than the percentage of students passing math. \n",
    "\n",
    "When observing the average math score per grade across all schools in the district, it was found that grade 10 had the most occurrences of the minimum math score across al years. Therefore, it would be wise to focus on this grades performance in math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this analysis is limited to being able to visualise the amount of budget allocated to math and reading resources, if it were found that there were to be a deficit in maths allocated amount, this is something which could be prioritised such as hiring more expeirenced staff and resources for math. \n",
